    <p>This is World Étude, a masterpiece from Altair's VA, Ms. Toyosaki Aki, which played at the 13<sup>th</sup> episode. If you don't know anything about Altair, she's a character from this relatively obscure anime called Re:CREATORS, from 2017.<br><br> Re:Creators is a Japanese anime television series produced by Troyca. The series follows Sōta Mizushino, a high school student who becomes involved in a battle between several characters from manga, anime, and video games who somehow appear in the real world.

        The first character to appear is Selesia Yupitilia, a princess and chevalière from the anime Vogelchevalier. She is soon followed by other characters, including Meteora Österrich from the RPG game Avalken of Reminisce, and many others.
        
        <br><br>The characters are initially confused and disoriented, but they soon learn that they have been brought to the real world by a mysterious figure known as Military Uniform Princess, known later as Altair. Altair is, unlike others, not bound to a specific series, is therefore able to pierce the real world as well. And she is determined to destroy the real world and everyone in it, for she is adamant that the real world has wronged her creator into her suicide.
        
        Sōta and the other characters team up to stop Altair, but they soon realize that she is more powerful than they anticipated. They must also come to terms with their own identities and motivations as fictional characters.
        
        <br><br>In the end, Sōta and the other characters are not able to defeat Altair by traditional means, resorting to essentially 'creating' Setsuna Shimazaki, Altair's creator, so she can be with her forever. Although not technically beaten, she has fulfilled her reason for destruction, and ceases to exist. In proxy, saving the real world, and the character's own worlds as well.
        <br><br>The song, World Étude, represents her lament to the world, which has wronged her creator, and wishes for it's destruction. The lyrics, as rageful as it is, also dives into the fact that she was born for this very purpose, and whether she could have done anything to prevent her loss. From the lyric of "Fall from heaven, what i dreamnt of was a fantasy", she is acknowledging the fact that it may be only a dream for her wish to be true, and to realize it, she might have to descend from heaven, essentially becoming the thing she is being portrayed in the anime. She was not made to be evil, she was not made to be cynical, but she chooses to do it, since it's all she know about.
        <br><br>tl/dr: trash plot, wack characters, but one of the absolute best soundtrack and music in anime there is :D
    <br>
    </p>
    this anime could very well be an excuse so that the soundtracks and OP/ED could be made
    <p>here's the <a href="music/lyric/etude" target="_blank">lyric</a>, but it's in english</p>
