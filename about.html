                Hello! My name is Dimas Aditya Pancasakti, I'm a college student from Indonesia with a passion
                for all things related to computers. My interests encompass both software and hardware 
                engineering, making me a tech enthusiast at heart.</p>
            <p> 
                When I'm not diving into the world of computers, you can often find me lost in the captivating
                melodies of J-pop, especially from artists like Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimer, supercell,
                Official Hige Dandism, and YOASOBI.</p>
            <p>
                My curiosity drives me to explore the ever-evolving realm of technology, seeking to understand
                the intricate components that power our digital world. I'm always eager to learn, and I'm here 
                to answer questions, and learn from others who share my interests.</p>
            <p>
                Please note that while i might appear to be antisocial, that isn't the case. I never started 
                conversations because i don't have anything interesting going on in my life, and i don't really
                catch up to the happenings around me or my country. But if you decide to talk to me, i will try
                my best to keep you as engaged as i can.
            </p>
